## Coursera Courses

### Applied Social Network Analysis

Course offered by University of Michigan through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-social-network-analysis/).

##### Impact:
 - Acquired skills and methods for modeling real-world data as a network.
 - Increased ability to quantify either:
   - Important or central nodes in large networks
   - Connectivity and robustness of a network
 - Exposed to new ideas for applying supervised learning to predict the evolution of networks over time (e.g. which new connections are likely)
 
### Deep Learning Specialization

Specialization including 4 courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai) through [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

Courses:
 1. Introduction to Neural Networks
 2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
 3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
 4. Convolutional Neural Networks

##### Impact:
 - Understand the mathematics behind how deep neural networks work and how to implement them efficiently.
 - Skills for systematically structuring machine learning projects and improving model performance.
 - Deeper understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as residual networks, and how to apply them to object detection and recognition tasks with image or video data.
